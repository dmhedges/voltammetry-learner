# voltammetry-learner

Voltammetry is an electrochemical technique that has been adapted to monitoring real-time release of easily oxidizable 
neurochemicals such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and others. Classically, neurochemicals are released from
tissue using electrical stimulation. Recent advances are measuring these neurochemicals through spontaneous release events.
Spontaneous releases of neurochemicals are significantly smaller, occur unpredicably, and are much harder to analyze.

This project is designed to use articifial intelligence to analyze and classify raw voltammetric recordings.

Phase one of this project is building a training data bank for the learning algorithms using Python signal processing.
Phase two will feed the training data into machine learning algorithms.

This project is under active development and thus may be full of bugs, head aches, and potential deep despair. Use at your own risks.
